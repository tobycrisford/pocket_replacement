# Pocket replacement

tldr version: Don't try to use this.

I use Pocket to save webpages to read later, but sometimes the website runs slowly, and this is frustrating.

I asked Claude to create a Chrome extension that would do the same thing, including syncing across devices, and was initially incredibly impressed with what it created. It immediately gave me the complete source code to a Chrome extension that seemed to work like a charm, and it would seamlessly add each new feature that I asked it to, even making it look 'cool' with some nice CSS at the end.

However, when I tried to start using it, I noticed some pages from my 'favourites' list inexplicably moving back to the main list, so I now know there are some pretty major bugs somewhere in this implementation.

Becuase I wrote none of the code, and I am not particularly familiar with javascript, and I know nothing about Chrome extensions, these bugs will now be tricky for me to track down. I tried asking Claude what could be happening, but wasn't very impressed with its suggestions. The whole point of this project was to see if LLMs could help me build a non-trivial web application with essentially zero effort, so I probably won't bother doing any more work on this.

Leaving this up as an interesting illustration of the power and limitations of using LLMs to write code.
